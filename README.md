## History

My name is Arnas Jelizarovas, a physics graduate. I have been interested in tech all my life, tinkering with computers and software, looking for things to break so I could figure out how to fix them. I was banned from using my computer back in the early 2000s, because I took out a hard drive from my computer to my friends house to transfer a game that wouldn’t fit on a floppy disk. I was caught putting the drive back in, even though I thought I knew what I was doing, my non-technical parents saw it as destroying a very expensive piece of equipment. In 2006 I got on the Internet and my world changed. I discovered South park, and I wanted everybody to be able to see it on demand, so I made my first website with PHP-Fusion. I taught myself how to edit templates initially, so started my career with minimal Front End Design. I found free hosting sites, but the available storage couldn’t even fit more than 2 episodes. So later I pivoted to a jokes website. But it got hacked and I put web dev on pause until 2008. Then the local youth group developed a youth news platform asjaunas.lt (I’m young…), and it was operational for a few years. 2006-2008 I was mostly interested in and learned a lot about making videos, VFX and graphic design. Designed some posters for local school and nightclub events. Which led me to designing  an event homestead website. Again it was a design in Photoshop sliced up, and certain parts of the html file replaced with text. Now July of 2011 is when I got into coding actual websites. I took C++ coding course earlier that year, and familiarized myself with basic concepts such as variables, functions etc. Which allowed me to propose and make a waiting ticketing system. Learned php and delivered a working system overnight, and it was a great success! This gave me confidence and allowed me to work on a little more complicated homestead rental website which allowed scheduling. Shortly after that, I was approached to make a copy of Medical product website in native language. After that I didn’t get back to development until 2015 september, when I applied and got the job to be a jr. web developer. I debugged a couple local mall websites and made one wordpress (writing a theme from scratch) for a local hemp oil company. But working two jobs and full time university was getting too much for me, so I quit in january.
